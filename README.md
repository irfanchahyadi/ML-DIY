Machine Learning - Do It Yourself

ML-DIY contain some of Machine Learning algorithm written from scratch by myself.
Built on top of basic python module like Numpy and Matplotlib. Imagine like code my own Scikit-Learn.
I create this in order to fully understand what's going on behind ML algorithm such as KMeans, KNN, Decision Tree, etc.
